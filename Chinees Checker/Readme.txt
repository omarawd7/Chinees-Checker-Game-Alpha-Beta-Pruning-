- Programming language used in this project: Python.


- To run the program, open the GameEngine file in Python IDE and run the interface to play the Chinese Checkers game. Human color will be green and AI color will be red.


- Design for the Game: A two-dimensional Graphical User Interface was used to represent the board in the game.
 Additionally, an object was developed to represent the board and the current placements of each of the pieces.
 Each player has ten pieces that are arranged in a triangle arrangement and can interact with any piece on the board and make any legally permissible moves.
 The game has three different levels:Easy, Medium, and Hard:-
 1- Easy mode creates a new board with the title "Chinese Checkers with Easy mode",and AI play using alpha beta algorithm with depth = 1.
 2- Medium mode creates a new board with the title "Chinese Checkers with Medium mode",and AI play using alpha beta algorithm with depth = 2.
 3- Hard mode creates a new board with the title "Chinese Checkers with Hard mode",and AI play using alpha beta algorithm with depth = 4.


- Heuristic calculates the distance between player home and player goal for each move and based on the average distance it got the score and alpha beta algorithm
 chooses the best move based on given score.
